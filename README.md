# NavMeshHorror
A project I made to get experience using the navmesh. 
I imported the zombie asset and environmental assets. 
However, I created the world, and scripts for movement and animation
You can test it out by clicking on unit games made.html
Once in the game, move with the wasd keys and look around with your mouse.
The zombie will try chasing you however, if you jump into the pit that I made around the center of the world, 
you will see that the zombie will move around the edges of a pit until it finds an openning. 
This is thanks to the navmesh and navagent added in the project. The purpose of this project was to get familiar with the use of navmesh
